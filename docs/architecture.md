### Styling Architecture

    For the styling, i used the BEM naming pattern

### For the Ui components

    I used parental-modularization(this is an architecture where logics are decoupled and invoked to a parent component when needed). Reason for this architecture is to enable efficient testing by simply practicing the DRY and SOC rule of clean coding

### For the redux structure

    I used a pattern called resource-modularization(this is a pattern where every resource have their types,actions and reducer nested inside their redux/resource-folder/....)
